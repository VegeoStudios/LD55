  - What is this? Why am I here?
  - God, my head hurts... Whats going on?
  - Whoa, I wasn't here a second ago!
  - What???
  - What's going on?!?!
  - AHHHHHHHH!!!!
  - ...
  - Wait, this isn't right...
  - Where... am I?
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - This... this can't be real.
  - What's happening? Where am I?
  - I feel like I've stepped into a different dimension.
  - I need to stay calm and figure out what's going on.
  summoned2:
  - Another world? Sounds like an adventure waiting to happen!
  - Summoned to another world? That's awesome!
  - New world? New challenges, people to meet, and things to explore!
  - Oooo, EXCITING!
  responses_cooperate:
  - Sure, I'll do your quest! But let's do it my way, not by the book.
  - I'll do your quest, but don't expect me to follow the rules.
  - I'll make sure no one gets hurt on the endeavor!
  - I'll make it happen! Just don't be too surprised if things get a little off the
    rails.
  responses_imprison:
  - Calling the guards on me? Looks like someone's afraid of what I might uncover.
  - Yeah, you can try to lock me up, but you can't contain my spirit!
  - The guards want to arrest me? Well, I'm sorry I couldn't break my back for your
    rules.
  succeeded:
  - Ah, I feel like I really made a difference in this world!
  - I have returned! Time for a drink! Cheers for a successful quest and to the people!
  - That was fun! Felt like I really did something. What's next?
  - Got the quest done, but I did have to take some alternative methods.
  failed:
  - Failing the quest is disappointing, but it won't stop me!
  - Failing the quest means I just need to double my efforts and try another approach.
  - I'll keep pushing forward, this failure won't set me back!
  - Quest failed... Oh well, it happens. Next one will be a success!
  injured:
  - Eh, it's a small price to pay for the lives we saved and the good we've done.
  - Injury? More like a badge of honor!
  - Worth every scar. This won't stop me from helping people!
  - Yeah, got myself a little injured. That was my fault though.
