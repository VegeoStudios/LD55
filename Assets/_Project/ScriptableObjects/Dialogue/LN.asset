  summoned1:
  - What is this? Why am I here?
  - God, my head hurts... Whats going on?
  - Whoa, I wasn't here a second ago!
  - What???
  - What's going on?!?!
  - AHHHHHHHH!!!!
  - ...
  - Wait, this isn't right...
  - Where... am I?
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - This... this can't be real.
  - What's happening? Where am I?
  - I feel like I've stepped into a different dimension.
  - I need to stay calm and figure out what's going on.
  summoned2:
  - I wonder if anyone else from my world is here.
  - Summoned to another world, you say? This is quite the unexpected turn of events!
  - Interesting... It seems my meticulous planning will need to adapt to this new
    world.
  responses_cooperate:
  - I'll cooperate, but expect me to ensure that my actions adhere to the laws of
    this realm.
  - I'll participate in your quest, but I reserve the right to question any morally
    ambiguous tasks.
  - I'm willing to cooperate as long as you have a good plan.
  responses_imprison:
  - Calling the guards is a grave misjudgement.
  - Summoning the guards only serves to escalate this situation beyond reason.
  - Imprisonment without due process? I'll see to it that your actions are brought
    before the proper authorities.
  succeeded:
  - I've returned vitorious, as exprected. Order has been restored to this realm.
  - My plan was perfect in every way. Failure was never a possibility.
  - The successful completion of the quest further solidifies my reputation as a
    lawful agent of change.
  failed:
  - The quest's failure is a lesson in the importance of adaptability and contingency
    planning.
  - My failure in the quest is regrettable, but it will not deter me from pursuing
    justice.
  - Failure is unacceptable. I must analyze my missteps and devise a more structured
    approach.
  injured:
  - Sustaining injuries is a reminder of the risks inherent in maintaining order.
  - Though injured, I shall press on.
  - This injury is nothing. It will not stop me from enacting justice!
