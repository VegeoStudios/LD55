  summoned1:
  - What is this? Why am I here?
  - God, my head hurts... Whats going on?
  - Whoa, I wasn't here a second ago!
  - What???
  - What's going on?!?!
  - AHHHHHHHH!!!!
  - ...
  - Wait, this isn't right...
  - Where... am I?
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - This... this can't be real.
  - What's happening? Where am I?
  - I feel like I've stepped into a different dimension.
  - I need to stay calm and figure out what's going on.
  summoned2:
  - Another world? Interesting. I wonder what opportunities for power await.
  - Summoned to another world? Well, let's just see what  I can stir up.
  - Another world beckons, and I intend to seize every advantage it offers.
  responses_cooperate:
  - Quest? Perhaps... if the rewards are worth my while.
  - I'll consider joining your quest, but only if it benefits me in some way.
  - I'll do it, but don't expect any blind loyalty. I am my own person!
  responses_imprison:
  - Guards? Ha! They won't contain me for long.
  - Wow, so touchy. Well sorry I broke your feelings. I'll find my own way out.
  - If the quest-giver wants to play dirty, I can play dirty too.
  succeeded:
  - Back from the quest, and richer for it. Who knew running these errands could
    be so profitable?
  - Success means I've gained more power. Watch out, world.
  - Triumph in the quest proves I'll stop at nothing to get what I want.
  failed:
  - Failing won't stop me, there are other ways to gain power.
  - I'll find another path to victory.
  - Failing the quest? Bah, no matter, I'm stronger than ever!
  injured:
  - Ah, the sweet pain of ambition. This compares nothing to what I'll achieve.
  - These are just reminders of my path to greatness!
  - I'll crush those guys next time, and I don't care who gets in my way.
