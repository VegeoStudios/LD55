  summoned1:
  - What is this? Why am I here?
  - God, my head hurts... Whats going on?
  - Whoa, I wasn't here a second ago!
  - What???
  - What's going on?!?!
  - AHHHHHHHH!!!!
  - ...
  - Wait, this isn't right...
  - Where... am I?
  - This isn't JAPAN!
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - This... this can't be real.
  - What's happening? Where am I?
  - I feel like I've stepped into a different dimension.
  - I need to stay calm and figure out what's going on.
  summoned2:
  - Wait, another world? That means I could do anything!
  - Welp, here I go being chaotic and evil again!
  - You there! Why did you bring me here?
  - I don't have time for this. I've got bigger fish to fry.
  responses_cooperate:
  - Sure, I'll help you with your little quest. Just remember, my loyalty only lasts
    until it's convenient for me.
  - Cooperate? Fine. But don't expect me to follow your precious rules or morals.
    I'll do what benefits me, and only me.
  - You want my help? Well, you better make it worth my while. And don't even think
    about trying to double-cross me.
  responses_imprison:
  - You really think those guards can hold me? You'll regret this, mark my words.
  - Call the guards if you dare. But remember, they'll have to catch me first, and
    that won't be easy.
  - You think you can just hand me over to the guards? You have no idea who you're
    dealing with.
  - Go ahead, call the guards. But just know that this won't end well for anyone
    involved.
  succeeded:
  - I'm back, and let me tell you, it was quite the adventure. But hey, you got what
    you wanted, didn't you?
  - Well, well, well, look who's back from saving the day. Don't act too surprised,
    I told you I'd get it done.
  - You're welcome. Now, where's my reward? I don't have all day to stand around
    and bask in your gratitude.
  failed:
  - So what if I failed? It's not like I cared about your stupid quest anyway.
  - Failed? Me? Please, I was set up to fail from the start. This is on you, not
    me.
  - Failure is just a temporary setback. I'll get it done eventually, whether you
    like it or not.
  injured:
  - Do I look like I need your sympathy? I got injured because I chose to, not because
    I needed help.
  - Injured? Please, this is just a scratch. I've faced worse and come out on top.
  - I may be injured, but don't think for a second that I'm weak. I'll recover and
    come back stronger than ever.
