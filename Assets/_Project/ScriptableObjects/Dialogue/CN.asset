  summoned1:
  - What is this? Why am I here?
  - God, my head hurts... Whats going on?
  - Whoa, I wasn't here a second ago!
  - What???
  - What's going on?!?!
  - AHHHHHHHH!!!!
  - ...
  - Wait, this isn't right...
  - Where... am I?
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - Whoa, that felt weird.
  - This... this can't be real.
  - What's happening? Where am I?
  - I feel like I've stepped into a different dimension.
  - I need to stay calm and figure out what's going on.
  summoned2:
  - Another world? Huh, who knew this could actuall happen...
  - Hmmm, this could be a good opportunity...
  - Interesting, I think I could get in to a life here.
  responses_cooperate:
  - Cooperate with your quest? Fine, but let's make it interesting. I'm not one for
    following the beaten path.
  - Count me in, but don't be surprised if I bend a few rules along the way. Gotta
    keep things exciting, right?
  - I'll join your quest, but don't think you can control me. I'm in it for my own
    reasons, not yours.
  responses_imprison:
  - Calling the guards on me? Seems a bit excessive, don't you think? Let's settle
    this like adults.
  - You want to involve the guards? Be my guest. But remember, they might not be
    as impartial as you think.
  - Calling the guards? Bold move. Let's see if they can keep up with someone who
    doesn't play by the rules.
  succeeded:
  - Back from the quest, and surprisingly, everything went smoothly. Maybe I'm getting
    the hang of this hero stuff.
  - Well I supposed I fulfilled your request. Is there anything more interesting
    to do in this world?
  - Well, all done, and I came back alive. Hope you're satisfied.
  failed:
  - Ah well, you win some, you lose some. Whats the next mission?
  - So, I didn't succeed. Big deal.
  - Not the end of the world. I can find other ways to make my mark
  injured:
  - Got a little banged up. No big deal.
  - Injuries happen out on the field. I'll be fine.
  - Oh that? That's nothing. Don't worry about it.
